# Super Smash Bros. React #

Test your Super Smash Bros. memory with this React app. :punch:

## What this project does ## 

This app is bootstrapped with [`Create React App`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The application's UI is broken into `components`, rendered by `state`, and responds to user events.

## How users can get started with this project ## 

1. **[Open Super Smash Bros. React](https://fkakatie.github.io/clicky)**.
    - Game play instructions are displayed immediately.
2. **Select a game mode**.
    - Choose a fighter roster from any Super Smash Bros. title, from the original 64 to Ultimate.
3. **Choose each fighter, but only once**.
    - On each selection, the fighters will be shuffled. Good luck!
4. **Win or lose**.
    - If you select the same fighter twice in a single game, you lose.
    - If you select each unique fighter only once in a single game, you win!
5. **Become the ultimate champion**!
    - ...by playing again!
